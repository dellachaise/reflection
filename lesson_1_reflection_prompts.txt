How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because you can see different between worked file and file with bugs, what lines was changed. And you shouldn't waiste your time to find differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could see changes in your program in progress.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - that you can add some special and binded chahges in one commit(for instance changes about registration form).
    Cons - your computer could be damaged befour your commit and your changes could be lost.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because of topic of this changes. Two or more files coul contain changes about one task.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - shows you history of commits.
    git diff - shows you differents with files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because you can compaire with privious version and easely correct mistakes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For everything:)
